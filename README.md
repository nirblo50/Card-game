# Python Online Card Game

##  About this project
```bash
--- see video.mp4 that included to see how the game runs ---

This project is an online card game (with 'Yaniv' rules).
In this project I mostly focused in the client-server communication and the mudularity of the project so there
is minimal user interface and graphics.

---True to march 2022 this game's server runs on Linode external server so the game can be played from any machine
But it is there for limited time, so if you tried to play and you receive an error -
you can only play on your local Lan (change the server_ip in client.py to your local ip)--- 
```
